# CS50w Project 0 - search

This is my submission for Project 0 for CS50w - A three-page website that emulates Google's frontend search.
It consists of three pages:
1. The home page, effectively the general Google search page (index.html)
2. The Image search page
3. The Advanced search page

Advanced search implements the first four Google advanced search parameters.
